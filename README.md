### Description

Physic Engine 2D.

** 2D physics ** Circle-Line intersection ** Line-Line Intersection ** Vector Reflaction ** Line bounce reaction ** Large Picture Scroll ** Vector Operations ** Dyinamic links ** Particle ** Vehicle **

----

Main creature is called "bot" and is implemented by the class clsbot. It consists of: POINTS that can be pure, wheeled or motorized wheels; LINKS that work like springs and they bind the points together; MUSCLES between the links that are defined as an angle that the links should take and a strength. This Class should be used for more general pourpose, but in this case it manages the vehicle and the ground. *** New features: * Collision of not wheeled points. * Impoved doMuscles Sub. * Dynamic Links, Dynamic Muscles.
